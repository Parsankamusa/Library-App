# Library-App
# Frappe/Flask/Django test for entry level engineers
# Why this test?

At Navari, we build applications for the web, so understanding how web applications work, is a pre-requisite for any new engineer.

If you have never worked on web applications before, this test will also help you evaluate whether this is something you are skilled at or can easily learn doing. Given our stack majorly comprises of Python & JavaScript, we expect an application with a Python backend.
